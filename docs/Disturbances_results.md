### TOLERANCING ANALYSIS

Nominal case:

- Yield of PPOP for some universes
- Total yield matrix

- Exoplanet archive yield

Using all OPDs:

- Mean, RMS, STD of OPD distribution
- Fitted gaussian OPD of OPD distribution
- RMS vs STD of OPD distribution
- OPD vs nulling ratios 

- OPD at pupil plane for some simulations
- Phases at pupil plane for some simulations

Using RMS of OPDs for simulations:

- Some transmission maps
- STD of transmission maps
- PCA of transmission maps and PC1 score
- Some difference maps of transmission maps
- CDF of transmission maps at central pixel

- Some PSF
- STD of PSF
- PCA of PSF and PC1 score
- Some difference maps of PSF
- CDF of PSF at central pixel

- Yield of PPOP for some universes
- Total yield matrix

- Exoplanet archive yield

### INTERFEROMETER ARMS

One arm is perturbed:

- Intensity response at different angles
- Nulling ratio
- Mean nulling ratio
- Median nulling ratio
- Worst case nulling ratio
- Fraction of good nullin ratio

- Response function for nominal and perturbed case


Multiple arms are perturbed:

- Intensity response at different angles
- Nulling ratio
- Mean nulling ratio
- Median nulling ratio
- Worst case nulling ratio
- Fraction of good nullin ratio

- Response function for nominal and perturbed case

### COMPARE CONFIGURATIONS

Using RMS of OPDs for simulations

- Modulation efficiency
- Nulling ratio
- Cumulative plot of different configuratiosn
